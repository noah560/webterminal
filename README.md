webterminal allows websites to run terminal code(with the user's permission).
A website will run `window.open("http://localhost:5000/com/?com=command");`, with command at the end being replaced with the command you want to run.
(i need help with some things. only the python program totally works)

The syntax for the new version is `window.open("http://localhost:9219/?c=command");`
